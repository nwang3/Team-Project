# Data Analysis interpretation
## Count
### The count tells me the number of non-null values in each column. For example, the "bed" column has 864,435 non-null values.
## Mean
### Mean represents the averages. For instance, the mean of the "bed" column is approximately 3.34, indicating that, on average, there are about 3 bedrooms.
## Standard deviation
### It measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. Larger standard deviations indicate more spread out values from the mean. For example, the std of the "bed" column is 2.08.
## Minimum
### It shows the smallest value in each column. In the "bed" column, the minimum value is 1, indicating at least one-bedroom.
## 25th Percentile (25%):
### It indicates the value below which 25% of the data falls. For example, in the "bed" column, 25% of the data has a value of 2 or less.
## 50th Percentile (50% or Median):
### It represents the middle value of the dataset. In the "bed" column, 50% of the data has a value of 3 or less
## 75th Percentile (75%):
### Also known as the third quartile, it indicates the value below which 75% of the data falls. In the "bed" column, 75% of the data has a value of 4 or less
## Maximum (max):
### It shows the largest value in each column. In the "bed" column, the maximum value is 123, which might be an outlier or an error in the data.
