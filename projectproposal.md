# Project Proposal
## The Big Idea
### The main idea of your project is to automate tedious Excel work with Python, for the tasks I have done in past internships. I wish to explore the following topics:
### 1. Automate financial modeling valuation of commercial real estate property to calculate metrics like Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for commercial real estate investments.
### 2. Using Commercial Real Estate API to conduct market research automatically
### 3. Create visualizations to represent trends, property values, rental income, and other relevant data. Visualization tools help in making informed decisions by providing a clear picture of the data.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
### Retrieves commercial real estate data from a chosen source.
### Performs basic data analysis to identify trends and patterns.
### Implements financial modeling to calculate NPV and IRR.

## Learning Objectives
### Since I am working on the project alone, my individual learning goal is to develop a comprehensive real estate asset management system using Python. I had two summer internships as an asset management intern at Commercial Real Estate firms before, and I worked long hours on manual Excel work. I am passionate about automating these tasks for similar jobs in the future.

## Implementation Plan 
### I need to find the most suitable commercial real estate raw data. I need to explore and experiment with Python libraries for data analysis and financial modeling. Some of the Python libraries I think would be helpful include Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, NumPy for math calculation, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

## Project Schedule
### Week 1-2: Project Setup and Data Exploration: Find available commercial real estate datasets.
### Week 3-4: Develop Python scripts for data retrieval and basic analysis and implement financial modeling using NumPy. Create a basic command-line interface for presenting results.
### Week 5: Use Commercial Real Estate API, using Flask to build website that prompts user to ender a market, and write code to extract relevant market research data as output
### Week 6: Testing, Refinement, and Documentation Conduct testing and identify and fix any bugs. 

## Collaboration Plan
### I am working on the project by myself.

## Risks and Limitations
### I'm most concerned with finding raw and authetic commercial real estate data. Because it will impact the accuracy of my financial models.

## Additional Course Content
### How to retrieve and extract relevant data from website?
### How can Python be used together with SQL for this project?
